Welcome to Space Station 14! You have just started your shift aboard a Nanotrasen space station and along with your crewmates should try to cooperate, perform your job role to the best of your ability and have fun amidst the chaos.

If you have any questions, consult this guide, your colleagues on shift in character or over radio. You can also ask admins for help (AHelp) by hitting the escape key > admin help and typing a message to any online admins.

Instead of intents, we have combat mode. Check controls below for its keybind. You can't attack anybody with it off, so no more hitting yourself with your own crowbar.
